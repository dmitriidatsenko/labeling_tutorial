You have the opportunity to be a teacher for our artificial intelligence, that tries to approximate roof contours.

### Requirements 

 1. Adobe Photoshop
 2. Adobe Illustrator (Optional)

### Tutorial
 1. Find the location of tiles obtained from Google maps to label on Machine Learning workstation.
    Folder: **"D:\Machine Learning\projects\Dmitrii\roofs_segmentation\data\datasets\tiles\Google\tolabel"**
 2. Select any you want to label.
 3. Be sure that imagery is not yet labeled in:
    Folder: **"D:\Machine Learning\projects\Dmitrii\roofs_segmentation\data\datasets\tiles\Google\psd"**
 4. Open the imagery in any application either Photoshop or Illustrator.
 #### Photoshop guide:
  1. Create separate transparent layer using combination Ctrl + Shift + N, that layer should be active all the time you fill contours with a mask:
