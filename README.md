    Folder: **"D:\Machine Learning\projects\Dmitrii\roofs_segmentation\data\datasets\tiles\Google\tolabel"**
 2. Select any you want to label.
 3. Be sure that imagery is not yet labeled in:
    Folder: **"D:\Machine Learning\projects\Dmitrii\roofs_segmentation\data\datasets\tiles\Google\psd"**
 4. Open the imagery in any application either Photoshop or Illustrator.
 #### Photoshop guide:
  1. Create separate transparent layer:
  2. Choose **pen**:
